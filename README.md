# interpreting_model_coefficients

**interpreting_model_coefficients** reviews fitting models and interpreting their coefficients.

It is important that not only can you fit complex linear models, but that you then know which variables you can interpret.

In this notebook, you will fit a few different models and use the quizzes below to match the appropriate interpretations to your coefficients when possible. In some cases, the coefficients of your linear regression models wouldn't be kept due to the lack of significance. But that is not the aim of this notebook - this notebook is strictly to assure you are comfortable with how to interpret coefficients when they are interpretable at all.

This project was done as part of [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) program.
